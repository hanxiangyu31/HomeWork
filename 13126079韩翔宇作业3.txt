The Basic Concepts of CFT
Hanxiangyu(13126079)

Control flow testing(CFT) is a traditional form of white-box testing. It is a structural testing strategy that uses the program¡¯s control flow as a model. Its techniques are based on selecting a set of test paths through the program. The set of paths chosen is used to achieve a certain measure of testing thoroughness, such as pick enough paths to assure that every source statement is executed as least once. Control flow testing procedure generally consists of three steps. Firstly, from the source, create the control flow graph (CFG): it describes the flow of control. Secondly, define a ¡°coverage target¡± over the CFG. Finally, design test cases to cover ¡°coverage target¡±.
